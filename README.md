Housing Price Clusters and Prediction
 King County, WA

Introduction

Time your project correctly and millions can be made; make a couple of bad business decisions and you’ll be out of business. With improved data, decisions can be made based on facts and data. In the past, home builders relied on their gut and focus groups. SM2R2 was able to obtain a dataset containing house sale prices for the surrounding Seattle area from a contact at the local real estate board whom we’ve partnered with. It includes homes sold between May 2014 and May 2015.

Objective

Determine what are the factors that will influence buyers the most. Within the market, different amenities appeal to different consumer groups. Some consumers are first time buyers, they prioritize space for growing families, others are empty nesters looking to downsize. The amenities which various buyers prefer and optimize the designs to home buyers which appeals to the largest number of buyers. While everyone wants their money to go further, if too many amenities are added, it will unnecessarily increase costs. The overriding objective of this endeavour is to determine the total sales revenue to confirm the viability of the project. SM2R2 will also optimize the revenue per square foot of each home, as well as, optimizing the lot size.
